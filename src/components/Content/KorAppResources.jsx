                <dd>You learn Korean words, sentences, and grammar while 
                    working in a cute farm and fighting monstrous vegetation.
                    What more could you want?

                    This is a very good beginner course. I never finished it, of course, 
                    but it helped me greatly when I was starting my Korean learning journey.

                <dd>What I like about this is that the lessons are extremely short,
                    which is perfect for my attention span. It's going to be particularly
                    fun for you if you're into k-pop, but I found it useful and fun even 
                    though I had no idea who those people were. Once again, there are free and premium 
                    features, and once again, you can just use the free ones like I did.

                <dd>Useful to practice grammar and listening exercises, the kind you'd
                    find in a TOPIK test. Even if you're not planning on taking the test, 
                    the exercises are useful.
