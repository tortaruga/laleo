            <dd>This app has everything: games to practice japanese characters,
                grammar lessons, exercises, and a very cute mascot cheering you on.

            <dd>I like it because the lessons are fun, short and effective.
                It's only free up to a point, but I think those free lessons are enough for beginning.</dd>

            <dd>This is useful to practice the kind of grammar and kanji exercises that
                would be in a JLPT test (which is beneficial even if you don't plan on taking the exam).
                I honestly don't really know what the premium features even are, because
                as you probably can tell I only ever use the free features of anything.

            <dd>I used it for Korean, but it supports other languages as well, including Japanese.
                It's cute and fun, and it makes learning a game. It covers mostly vocabulary,
                and a bit of grammar here and there.
