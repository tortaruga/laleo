### overview

Website made mostly as layout practice. I wanted to try and build a site with multiple sections, and while I was at it I tried experimenting with using Bootstrap in a React project.

The content is just an excuse for the coding practice. It's a collection of online resources that I find useful in my journey to learn Japanese and Korean, plus some personal advice for people wanting to learn a language on their own. 
Take what resonates, leave the rest.

##### notes
 
The project's aim was to create a website that felt cohesive and to organize some content in a way that made sense and was easy to navigate.
Although design is not my strongest suit, the final product is clean, intuitive, and responsive. The navigation experience is pleasant both on big screens and mobile devices, and the use of tab sections and accordions to group the content gives the site a visually tidy feeling.
